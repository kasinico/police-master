	<h2>Preventing car theft</h2>

<h6>Car thieves are becoming increasingly organized and, in a few seconds, can have your vehicle taken far away.</h6><p>

<h6>Bear in mind that criminals will choose an easy target. By following the steps below you can make it difficult for a criminal to steal your car.</p></h6>
<form>
<ul>
   <li> Close all windows and lock all doors and the boot (trunk), even if you only leave your car for a moment.</li>

    <li>Never leave your vehicle running unattended.</li>

   <li> Where possible, park in a well-lit highly visible area, preferably off the road.<br>
   At night, choose secure or well-lit car parks, 
   with pedestrian traffic. Avoid leaving your vehicle in a car park for a long time.</li>

    <li>Try to park the vehicle with the front facing an obstacle. Turn the wheels <br>
	towards the kerb and lock the steering.</li>

    <li>Always try to use all protection you have on the vehicle. 
	Put all labels for protection devices in a visible place (do not display your GPS label).</li>

   <li> Disable the vehicle using a starter interrupt switch ("kill switch").
   Installation is not expensive.</li>

   <li> Use VIN etching. This chemically etches the Vehicle Identification Number 
   <br>or registration number on the windows 
   of your vehicle which is an effective deterrent for thieves. 
   <br>"Chop shops" 
   (places where stolen cars are disassembled to be sold for parts) thrive on vehicles<br>
   that have easily removable VINs or no etching at all.</li>

   <li> If you leave the vehicle for a longer period, take off the fuses, or disconnect <br>
   the power supply, after consultation with your mechanic service.</li>

</ul>



	<h2>What to do if your vehicle is stolen</h2>
	<ul>
	<li> Always have the following information about your vehicle ready: year, make/model,<br>
	license plate, Vehicle Identification Number (VIN), colour, any distinguishing <br>
	features, radio number and GPS number. 
	    <li>Keep note of distinguishing marks such as scratches and dents. Also, permanently <br>
		etch or mark accessories with your driver's license number,<br>
		and drop a business card down the window slot to serve as identification in the <br>
		event the VIN is removed. </li>
		
		<li> Stolen vehicles are often used to commit other offences (bank roberries, murders, etc.).<br>
		It is very important to report the theft as soon as possible.</li>

 </li>
